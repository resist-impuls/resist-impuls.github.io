# Work Packages

The RESIST project is structured in 5 scientific Work Packages (WP 1-5) and 3 additional management / dissemination Work Packages (WP 6-8). Below is a diagram with these WPs, the connection between them and the tools used in each scientific WP. The goals and main tools of each scientific WP are provided below this diagram.

## WP1: Local drivers of observed sea ice lows
**Goal:** estimate the pysical processes affecting the sea ice concentration tendencies prior and during a sea ice low.

**Tool:** NEMO-SI3 ocean-sea ice general circulation model (https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/framework/components/engines/) run at different horizontal resolutions (1째, 1/4째, 1/12째).

## WP2: Large-scale drivers of observed sea ice lows
**Goal:** discriminate the fraction of the summer sea ice anomalies that are due to preconditioning (initial conditions) vs. external drivers of sea ice variability (winds and SST).

**Tool:** EC-Earth3 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (https://ec-earth.org/) run at 1째 in the ocean and 80 km in the atmosphere.

## WP3: Mechanisms responsible for sea ice lows in state-of-the-art climate models
**Goal:** test the dynamical causal dependencies between sea ice and its drivers and impacts.

**Tool:** Liang-Kleeman information flow method (https://doi.org/10.3390/e23060679) applied to large ensembles of climate model simulations, CMIP6 model outputs and model reconstructions.

## WP4: Statistics of extreme sea ice events
**Goal:** derive robust statistics for the most extreme sea ice states in a state-of-the-art climate model.

**Tool:** rare event algorithm (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1712645115) applied to EC-Earth3 model simulations.

## WP5: Regional impacts of sea ice lows
**Goal:** assess the regional response of the atmosphere to sea ice lows in observations and climate models.

**Tool:** observations and climate models (EC-Earth3, large ensembles, CMIP6).
