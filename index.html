       <p> RESIST (Recent Arctic and Antarctic sea ice lows: same causes, same impacts?) is a project funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO). 
           Its aim is to document, qualitatively and quantitatively, the cause-effect relationships between summer sea ice lows in both polar regions and 
         their potential interacting agents (drivers and impacts) </p>
