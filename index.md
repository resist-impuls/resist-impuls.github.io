# RESIST
RESIST (Recent Arctic and Antarctic sea ice lows: same causes, same impacts?) is funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office ([BELSPO](https://www.belspo.be/belspo/index_en.stm)). Its aim is to document, qualitatively and quantitatively, the cause-effect relationships between summer sea ice lows in both polar regions and their potential interacting agents (drivers and impacts).
